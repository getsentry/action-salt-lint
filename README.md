# Salt Lint for GitHub Action
This action allows you to run `salt-lint` with no additional options.

The project is heavily based on [ansible-lint-action](https://github.com/ansible/ansible-lint-action), which was created by [Stefan Stölzle](/stoe) and is now maintained as part of the [Ansible](https://ansible.com/) by [Red Hat](https://redhat.com/) project.

## Usage
To use the action simply add the following lines to your `.github/workflows/main.yml`.

```yaml
on: [push]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: Salt Lint Action Demo
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v1
    - name: Run salt-lint
      uses: getsentry/action-salt-lint@master
      env:
        ACTION_STATE_NAME: init.sls
```

N.B. Use `v0.0.1` or any other valid tag, or branch, or commit SHA instead of `master` to pin the action to use a specific version.

### Environment Variables
- **ACTION_STATE_NAME**: (optional) defaults to `init.sls`
